# python-challenge
In this assignment, I used the concepts I learnt to complete two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll. Both tasks present a real-world situation where my newly developed Python scripting skills come in handy.

In this Challenge, I created a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company. I used a financial dataset "budget_data.csv". The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses"
My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
The total number of months included in the dataset
The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The second part of this challenge I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.
I used a dataset called "election_data.csv". The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate".
My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
The total number of votes cast
A complete list of candidates who received votes
The percentage of votes each candidate won
The total number of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote
